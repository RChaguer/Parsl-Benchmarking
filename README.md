# Parsl - Parallel Scripting Library for Python:Benchmarking, Analysis, Expedition &amp; Improvement

This project was conducted by AI major students of Illinois Institute of Technology. We would like to thank Dr. Ioan Raicu, our supervisor for this research project and for the "Data Intensive Computing" course. We are extremely glad for this opportunity to learn about numerous fields outside of our expertise such as parallel computing in Python.

## Abstract 
Parsl is a parallel scripting library for Python. It facilitates and improves using multi-threading and parallel scripting in Python. Despite having other competitor libraries Parsl has proven to be one of the fastest, but it is still slow in comparison with other low level libraries. We will benchmark Parsl in numerous use cases and examine the situations where Parsl excels, but also study other cases, such as fine-grained parallelism, where it fails to create a fast, highly-scalable parallel script.
